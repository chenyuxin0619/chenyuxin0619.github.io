      <h1>Research Proposal</h1>
      <p>
        The COVID-19 pandemic has reshaped the world in many ways: students
        switched to distance learning, labour switched to WFH, local restaurants
        rely on delivery services (Uber Eats, Door Dash), and famous brands use
        online promotion more heavily. All mentioned above are based on the
        Internet which has developed for decades, yet I am curious about where
        our next step is: Can our Internet experience be more immersive and
        interactive? Previous studies indicated that Metaverse could be the
        solution. But how far are we from an all-in-one and affordable metaverse
        experience? My research interest is to combine technologies like Web
        3.0, VR, AR, and Blockchain to provide the public with a new way to
        study, work and entertain.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Metaverse is the post-reality universe, a perpetual and persistent
        multiuser environment merging physical reality with digital virtuality,
        the metaverse is based on virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality
        (AR). (Mystakidis, 2023) Vishwakarma, Shaikh, and Yadav (2023) also
        agreed that Metaverse is the new future, a new world. Currently, there
        is an intense race to construct the infrastructure, protocols, and
        standards that will govern the Metaverse. Large corporations are
        striving to construct their closed, proprietary hardware and software
        ecosystems to attract users and become the de facto Metaverse
        destination. For example, Facebook was renamed Meta years ago, and the
        leading Chinese technology company, Bite Dance, is investing heavily in
        Metaverse. Yet which country is dominating this research field? Some may
        argue that it must be the United States of America while others argue
        that non-English speaking counties like Spain, China, and Indian in fact
        lead our way in this round of metaverse revolution. López-Belmonte,
        Pozo-Sánchez, Moreno-Guerrero, and Lampropoulos (2023) did systematic
        research about metaverse in education in their paper. They use the open
        database and do a literature review to answer a series of questions
        including What have been the most prominent countries in the production
        of the educational metaverse? What have been the most relevant
        objectives in the documents on the educational metaverse? What research
        methodologies have been used in studies on the educational metaverse?
        and What have been the main findings analyzed in research on the
        educational metaverse? López-Belmonte et al. (2023) state that a
        predominance of publications in Brazil and Spanish-speaking countries
        (Spain, Mexico, and Colombia) has been confirmed. This fact reflects a
        lack of scientific literature in English-speaking and Asian countries,
        which usually reflects high levels of production in pioneering research
        in educational contexts.

        We see the public interested in the idea of a metaverse which is proved
        by the success of the game “Animal Crossing”: when the city is locked
        down, friends and families can still arrange parties in the game. JP
        Morgan (2022) has also drafted a blueprint of opportunities regarding
        metaverse for us: 1) People spend $54 billion on virtual goods every
        year (this is almost double the amount people spend on music) 2)
        Approximately 60 billion messages are sent daily on Roblox. 3) More than
        $80 million USD was paid to the creator. 4) NFTs currently have a market
        cap of 41 billion US dollars. We also see the metaverse era coming into
        the academic circle, Damar (2021) suggests till 2021, there are 42
        articles produced about the metaverse and these articles are cited 217
        times. Bale, Ghorpade, Hashim, Vaishnav, and Almaspoor (2022) state in
        their comprehensive study on the Metaverse that the metaverse
        contributes to Experienced Virtual Tours, Meetings and Conferences,
        Workouts and Exercise, Education, Training, E-commerce, and Trade of
        Digital Assets.

        However, like many new ideas, opportunities are born with risks.
        Metaverse platforms like Meta and Sandbox are launching explosively,
        however, we must be aware of the potential bubble inherited from it.
        Vidal-Tom ́as (2023) states that we see the explosive launch of metaverse
        tokens in past years. However, with the explosive behaviour of the
        native currencies in all the metaverse, and the influence of the tokens
        on the NFT price, the potential risk exists and the metaverse is only an
        illusion. Personally, I believe NFTs are still in their infant stage
        which lacks government regulation, and the current NFT market has moral
        hazard and adverse selection problems. And from the social perspective,
        scientists should focus on the long-run benefit rather than focus on the
        profit from speculations. Vishwakarma et al. (2023) state that privacy
        and security are also other important factors to be a concern when
        entering the metaverse, especially when trading in the metaverse, due to
        the current limitations of VR and its technology, users are not able to
        fully recognize their surroundings in the metaverse and who they are.
      </p>

        Said (2023) used a sampling model in his research and concluded that the
        Metaverse will have a revolutionary impact on the future of electronic
        and hybrid learning and training. Mystakidis (2023) argued that
        educational institutions can benefit a lot from the metaverse: imagine
        that a high school teacher is showing the class how life in ancient
        Egypt was, then students put their VR headsets on, and suddenly they all
        travel back to ancient Egypt. The experiment design from Said has
        inspired me that I must take demographic features into consideration
        when creating my own design. For example, if I were to study the level
        of acceptance of education in the metaverse, I should limit my
        respondent to those who were mature enough to use VR headsets.
      </p>

        In 2021 Zuckerberg introduced the metaverse office concept. Metaverse
        office refers to the ability to allow users to customize a digital
        avatar, let companies set up their metaverse office, and enable
        communication between members through virtual space. Chen (2023) argued
        that technology provides companies with low-cost office space, flexible
        work options for employees, and reduced carbon emissions and energy
        consumption. Compared to traditional work methods, metaverse office
        combines flexibility and low cost, which is why some companies choose
        this model. Yet a cost and benefit analysis is necessary before
        promoting the metaverse office to the massive public. Currently, we see
        some shortcomings in the metaverse office, for example, salespersons
        still prefer face-to-face conversation over meetings in the metaverse.
        In addition, companies may consider the sunk cost of implementing
        metaverse office as the devices are still very pricy. Thus, when
        promoting the metaverse office we could introduce a rent-to-own method.
      </p>

        E-commerce is also a crucial part of the metaverse. Currently, the trade
        volume from e-commerce is increasing each year, this has directly
        created many wonderful companies including Alibaba, Tiktok, and Amazon.
        People are betting on the metaverse business for the future. Utoyo,
        Warbung, Bonafix, Aorilla and Oei (2022) in their research answered the
        question of why big brand advertising in the metaverse. Periyasami and
        Periyasamy (2022) did a case study on metaverse as a future promising
        platform business model and found the key challenge to be currency and
        trust. Cryptocurrency is gaining popularity all around the world, and it
        will be much more important in the ecology of a metaverse if it ever
        becomes one. In addition to that, blockchain technology and
        cryptocurrencies have shown several noteworthy benefits over traditional
        forms of the financial business. Manufacturing and enterprises of
        different destinations need to re‐look at their strategy. Utoyo,
        Warbung, Bonafix, Aorilla and Oei (2022) answered why big brand
        advertising is in the metaverse.

        The entire research process will take about 7-8 months. To finish my
        research, I would use a questionnaire and use the result from the
        questionnaire to proceed with regression analysis. I will start the
        questionnaire design at the beginning of my PhD program as it is the
        most time-consuming part of this research. Also, I must admit that my
        vision is limited thus I need to discuss it with my friends, classmates,
        and professors to ensure the quality of the questionnaire. After handing
        out the questionnaire, I will start my literature review before creating
        the regression model. When we get the results from the questionnaire, we
        should also have studied enough academic papers as preliminary research.
        This first stage will take about 3 months. The second stage consists of
        regression data collection/cleaning, model creation, and regression
        analysis. In this stage, the most time-consuming part is data collection
        which takes about 2-3 months. Note that the model would need peer review
        to ensure its quality. A first draft follows the end of the second
        stage. The third stage consists of a more detailed regression and
        questionnaire analysis. When finished, another peer view is needed
        before finishing the final draft. This whole process takes about 1
        month. The last stage takes about 1 month to complete the final writing
        and review and prepare the academic presentation.
